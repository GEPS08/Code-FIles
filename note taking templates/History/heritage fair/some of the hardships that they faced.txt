Dear Governor Haldimand, as we move north, we are experiencing many hardships and we only expect those hardships to increase once we arrive. We will need many different supplies to survive and thrive in our new homes, especially in the changing climate of the region. These supplies include seeds and other farming equipment to prepare the new land that we have been given to make farms and make our own food to become  a self-sustaining settlement. We will also need some rations of food until we can start harvesting our crops and producing our own food. We will require warm clothing and blankets so that we will be able to survive the long, harsh and cold winters of British North america. We will need the materials to build our houses and other forms of shelter. We will need tools for basic hunting and farming so we can maintain our crops and food income. We will need access to fresh water so we can water our crops and avoid dehydration. 

We expect to face many hardships and challenges once we arrive such as famine, dehydration as well as infertil land not viable for the growth of crops. We also expect hardships like extended amounts of labor and work to prepare our new land for crops and house building
Sincerely, The Loyalists
