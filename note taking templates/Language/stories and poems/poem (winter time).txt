i always like winter
best
you can eat warm soup
and filling turkey
and nice boiled maple syrup
pored in the snow
and go skating with
family
and skiing down
mountains and hills
and building forts with 
all my friends
out in the snow
and settling down
to watch tv
and thick
warm blankets
while you sleep
